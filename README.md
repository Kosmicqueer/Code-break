# Code-break
Hey, I'm Fletcher (they/them). I want to help create simple open source tools to help people in these revoluntionary times.
I have a lot of drive and a big heart, but absolutely no idea what i'm doing so any help is much appreciated. Its mostly my two braincells and chatgpt.
This app is a simple code breaker that allows you to reassign the meaning of one phrase to another and allows you to save those codes and share with friends. There is also a random code generation feature for up to 140 chracters.
Other features could be added later but that is all I am trying to do for version one. I have the code creation part mostly up and running but am having major issues with mongodb authentitication. 
These issues may be extremely simple to fix, but due to my lack of experience I am at a loss.
